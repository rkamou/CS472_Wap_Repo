The lecture was an overview on subjects that I already learned.  
Also, it was a kick on my memories(brain) on a lot of knowledges 
that was already fuzzy or almost forgotten.
I am glad we came on HTML5's tags (article, section, header, footer,
nav, figure, main, detail, aside, ...),since I never really took a 
time to study their semantics and the meaning underneath.
To sum up, this course is about to be very interesting. 

Lab0 is about making a very simple web personal page.
It looks easy, but when you are just comming back on when programming
from a long break, it can be surprisingly complicated. 
After reading thouroughly the course materials and Internet, it became 
a bit easier to toy with the tags and I made up my web page.
